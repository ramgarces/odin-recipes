        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a small/medium pan to medium heat.</li>
                <li>
                    While the pan is heating up slice your bacon into pieces.
                </li>
                <li>Once the pan is hot enough put the pieces of bacon into
                    the pan
                </li>
                <li>Cook the bacon as well as desired (I like my bacon crunchy
                    :D)
                </li>
                <li>Once the bacon is cooked to your liking, crack the eggs into
                    the pan with the bacon still in there.
                </li>
                <li>Scramble and mix the eggs with the bacon and cook your eggs
                    to your liking.
                </li>
                <li>Right before the eggs finish cooking, add salt and pepper to
                    taste.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
